# millionaire-trivia-game
Browser game written in js that may remind you of "Who wants to be a millionaire"    

# Prerequisites 
Click on the button "Start game" to start your quest on becoming a millionaire. Firstly, proceed to read carefully through the question. You have to choose only 1 correct answer.   
In order to do that simply click above the selected answer - a blue background will appear to assure you that you have chosen one. If you hesitate between 2 answers you may choose to use any of the lifelines: 
  
            `50/50`   ->  will eliminate 2 wrong answers  
            `Phone-A-Friend`  ->  will give you suggestion by a friend  
            `Public`  ->  will ask "the public" for the correct answer  
        
Then if your answer is correct you will proceed to the next one and if it is not - your game will be over. You may restart it any time by clicking on the "Restart" button.  
    Enjoy!
